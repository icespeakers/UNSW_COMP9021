A  bishop  keeps  on  saying  at  the  age  of  eighty  what  he  was  told  

to  say  when  he  was  a  boy  of  eighteen,  and  consequently  he  always  

looks  absolutely  delightful.  Your  mysterious  young  friend,  whose  name  

you  have  never  told  me,  but  whose  picture  really  fascinates  me,  never  

thinks.  I  feel  quite  sure  of  that.  He  is  a  brainless,  beautiful  thing,  who  

should  be  always  here  in  winter  when  we  have  no  flowers  to  look  at,  

and  always  here  in  summer  when  we  want  something  to  chill  our  intelligence.
