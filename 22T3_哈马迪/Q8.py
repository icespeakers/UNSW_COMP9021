def is_heterosquare(square):
    '''
    A heterosquare of order n is an arrangement of the integers 1 to n**2 in a square,
    such that the rows, columns, and diagonals all sum to DIFFERENT values.
    In contrast, magic squares have all these sums equal.

    Conjunctions of inputs will be tested, so hard coding will not help.

    >>> is_heterosquare([[1, 2, 3],\
                         [8, 9, 4],\
                         [7, 6, 5]])
    True
